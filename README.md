# Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning models. It leverages a dataset containing various health-related attributes and risk factors.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **File:** `Heart_Disease_Prediction.csv`
- **Description:** The dataset includes features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other health indicators that influence heart disease risk.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics analysis

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Notebook:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn 

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance

- **Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- **Baseline Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** GridSearchCV for optimal model selection

## ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements
